# WP-00 — `@scp/contracts`

## Summary
WP-00 establishes the shared integration foundation for the telemetry pipeline: canonical event envelope, versioned topic constants, payload schemas, and reusable consumer runtime behavior. Every downstream service depends on these contracts to avoid drift and incompatible message handling. Completing this WP freezes `v1` boundaries so other WPs can implement logic against stable interfaces.

## Depends on
- —

## Scope / Goal
Deliver a production-ready `@scp/contracts` package that provides:
- Canonical envelope schema and validators.
- Topic-name constants for all core `telemetry.*.v1` topics.
- Payload schemas for pipeline events.
- Shared consumer runtime primitives for bounded retry, DLQ routing, idempotency hooks, and offset-commit-after-side-effect policy.

## Out of scope / Deferred
- Introducing `v2` contracts or breaking changes to `v1`.
- Business logic for any concrete service (Authorizer, Registry Sync, IPFS, Blockchain, PubSub).
- Advanced workflow/SLA orchestration beyond bounded retry + DLQ.

## Inputs & Outputs
### Inputs
- Source-of-truth documents:
  - `docs/architecture/project-architecture.md`
  - `docs/architecture/integration-guide.md`

### Outputs
- Shared envelope schema using fields:
  - `event_id`, `event_type`, `event_version`, `occurred_at`, `trace_id` (optional), `source`, `payload`.
- Topic constants for:
  - `telemetry.authorized.v1`
  - `telemetry.rejected.v1`
  - `telemetry.pubsub.result.v1`
  - `telemetry.ipfs.result.v1`
  - `telemetry.blockchain.result.v1`
  - `telemetry.retry.v1`
  - `telemetry.dlq.v1`
- Payload schemas aligned with integration contracts draft for:
  - `telemetry.authorized.v1`
  - `telemetry.rejected.v1`
  - `telemetry.ipfs.result.v1`
  - `telemetry.blockchain.result.v1`
- Runtime interfaces/helpers used by consumers in later WPs.

## Detailed tasks / Implementation checklist
- [ ] Inventory existing contract stubs/TODOs in `packages/contracts` and replace all placeholders with concrete `v1` schema definitions.
- [ ] Define and export canonical envelope schema with strict required/optional field handling.
- [ ] Define and export topic constants exactly matching architecture docs.
- [ ] Implement/export payload schemas for all currently defined telemetry contracts from the integration draft.
- [ ] Freeze explicit placeholders or typed extension points for topics whose payloads are not yet fully specified by draft docs (without inventing contradictory fields).
- [ ] Implement shared consumer runtime policy primitives:
  - bounded retry policy,
  - DLQ routing to `telemetry.dlq.v1`,
  - idempotency hook interface,
  - commit-after-side-effect/result policy guardrails.
- [ ] Add reusable envelope + payload validation helpers for producers/consumers.
- [ ] Add contract tests to verify schema compatibility and topic constant stability.
- [ ] Add documentation/examples for importing topics, validating envelopes, and wiring retry/DLQ.

## Idempotency & error handling
- Event-level dedup key support must be based on `event_id`.
- Consumer runtime must enforce: consume → side effect → confirmation → result event → offset commit.
- Retries must be bounded and exhausted messages must be routed to `telemetry.dlq.v1` with error context.

## Testing
- Unit tests:
  - envelope schema validation,
  - payload schema validation,
  - topic constant exports,
  - retry/DLQ runtime behavior,
  - offset commit guard behavior.
- Contract tests:
  - compatibility for all `telemetry.*.v1` exports,
  - explicit assertions for canonical field names and requiredness.
- Integration test:
  - run against local `docker-compose` Kafka stack to validate retry and DLQ routing behavior via shared runtime.

## Definition of Done
- All `TODO` markers in `@scp/contracts` are replaced with real logic.
- Unit tests + integration test against local `docker-compose` infra are green.
- `pnpm build`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test` are green.
- Bounded retry + DLQ to `telemetry.dlq.v1` is implemented in shared consumer runtime primitives.
- Baseline structured logging hooks and health/metrics integration points expected by services are documented and usable.
- `v1` envelope field names and topic constants are frozen and used as the single source for downstream WPs.
